      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a passionate and results-driven Computer Engineer, proudly holding a degree from The Copperbelt University. With a versatile and hands-on background in web development, networking, and general IT support, I bring a holistic approach to solving digital challenges.

Currently, I serve as an IT Technician, System Administrator, and Data Controller at one of the leading logistics companies in the region. In this role, Iâ€™m responsible for the design, configuration, and maintenance of mission-critical IT infrastructure. I manage everything from user support and system backups to server administration, network security, and data integrity, ensuring business continuity and optimal system performance in a fast-paced environment.

In addition to my corporate role, I am the founder of a growing tech startup that delivers tailored IT solutions to businesses. Our services include:
<ul>
  <li>Network Design and Setup (LAN/WAN architecture, firewall configuration(Fortinet), VPNs)</li>
  <li>Custom Web Development (responsive websites, business portals, and dashboards)</li>
  <li>Database Design & Administration (MySQL, MongoDB)</li>
  <li>IT Support and Consultancy (cloud migration, security audits, digital strategy)</li>
</ul>
	    
I thrive on continuous learning and staying current with emerging technologies. Whether itâ€™s deploying containerized applications with Docker, improving network performance, or building user-friendly web interfaces with modern JavaScript frameworks, Iâ€™m always eager to take on new technical challenges and collaborative opportunities.

If you're looking to work with someone who combines practical experience with a strong engineering foundation and whoâ€™s truly passionate about tech Iâ€™d love to connect.
